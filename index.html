      <h1>Hello World!</h1>

      <p>
        My name is Adam Furlong, and congratulations, you have found my
        homepage! I plan to make this the centre of my online presence, linking
        every other account to and from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will put a photo of myself here, when I find one I like. (I conjecture
        all photos of myself are ugly, and I heard a rumour the Clay Maths
        Institute is offering a million dollars for a proof, or a counter
        example. /s)

      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I was born in 2002, and hail from a small village near the sea in County
        Wexford, Ireland. Growing up, I always loved maths and had a strong
        interest in science, especially physics and the formation of the
        universe. I was not a straight-A student, (<i>maybe</i>
        straight-B), but I did quite well in school. Despite this, I didn't
        really enjoy secondary school at all. It felt like such a massive chore,
        always 'learning' things about which I couldn't care less. But my
        university years, where I was blessed with the opportunity to think
        about maths all day, every day, were the best of my life. This next part
        is mainly about my university career, and at the end of the page, I will
        attach a list of some other hobbies of mine.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3>To Infinity...</h3>
          <p>
            Going into university in 2021, I wanted to study something
            maths-related, perhaps with some physics, that would be difficult
            enough to really challenge me ("pressure makes diamonds" and all
            that jazz). The course I chose was the unique
            <a
              href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/study-maynooth/undergraduate-studies/courses/bsc-theoretical-physics-mathematics"
              >BSc in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics</a
            >
            of Maynooth University. This is a three-year accelerated course, and
            is not for the meek. We were thrown straight into a third year
            Classical Mechanics class, which is difficult enough if you are a
            third year. This was tough, especially for the unfortunate souls who
            had not studied physics before (*whistles inconspicuously*). Pure
            Mathematics proved no easier, as the first semester forced us to
            realise that we knew almost nothing about mathematics.
            <a href="people.html">Another victim</a> summarised it well: "If you
            are looking for a fun freshers week don't do this course". That
            being said, I went on to absolutely adore the mathematics, get
            through the physics, and meet
            <a href="people.html">some amazing people</a>.
          </p>
          <p>
            After three of the best years of my life, I graduated in September
            2024. I am delighted to have earned a First Class Honours grade
            (83%), and
            <a
              href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/mathematics-and-statistics/undergraduate-studies/annual-prizes"
              >some awards</a
            >
            (eg. for attaining the highest grades in the Pure Mathematics exams
            of our final year). While I did work
            <s>my ass off</s> incredibly hard, I owe a great debt to the friends
            I made along the way. These achievements would have been impossible,
            and I would not be who I am today, without you. Thank you, one and
            all.
          </p>

          <h3>... And Beyond!</h3>
          <p>
            From September 2024 to August 2025 I furthered my studies by
            completing the
            <a
              href="https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/physics/our-courses/msc-theoretical-physics-and-mathematics"
              >MSc in Theoretical Physics and Mathematics</a
            >. This is the first year this course was run
            <s>(and it showed)</s>, and the class that enrolled was a bit
            smaller than the undergrad. There were plenty of interesting classes
            on offer. Here are some I enjoyed: Riemannian Manifolds, Quantum
            Field Theory, Measure Theory. The course consisted of 60 credits
            (ECTS) of classes, followed by 30 credits of a summer research
            project. For this, I studied Kernel Density Estimation: see the
            Projects tab.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again, I am proud to say I earned my First Class Honours (92%).
            (Though this is less a testament to my amazing mathematical prowess
            than it is to how lenient the Mathematics department was with their
            grading this year.) And again, my boundless gratitude belongs to
            those who made it possible, including my thesis supervisor Dr.
            Galatia Cleanthous. I believe the graduation ceremony will be in
            October.

          <h3>... And Then What?</h3>
          <p>
            ...watch this space. The long-term goal is to remain a life-long
            learner. There are mountains of mathematics to one day climb. I'd
            love to pick up some more programming along the way too. But for
            now, the short-term goal is to afford rent, and go through some
            personal development in other areas. I have many books to read, for
            example.

            It is a great tragedy that there are so many books that no one has
            time to read them all. Or, it is a great fortune that we will never
            run dry of the joy of reading a good book for the first time. The
            second view is far more fun. For my thoughts on some actual books,

          <h3>Speedcubing</h3>
          <p>
            I am sure you have heard of a Rubik's cube.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a>
            is the solving of this puzzle (or one of its variants) as fast as
            possible. If you are curious to learn, there are hundreds of
            tutorials on YouTube. I would recommend the channel
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm">JPerm</a>. Between that and
            his <a href="https://jperm.net/">website</a>, you will find
            everything you would ever need. Also, the entire community is
            extremely friendly and open to new members. There is most likely a
            group of speedcubers in your country you can contact, for example
            see

            and the linked discord channel. Upcoming competitions are listed
            <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions?">here</a

          <p>
            <i>'Isn't it all just algorithms?"</i> No. Solving these puzzles can
            be split into two phases. First, just moving pieces around to where
            they belong. This is just on-the-spot problem-solving, done by the
            intuition built though experience. Eventually though, so many pieces
            are in place that you cannot do anything without disturbing your
            progress. Only then do we turn to algorithms, sequences of moves
            which are memorised and practiced to be recognised and performed
            extremely quickly. For me on a standard 3x3 cube, these stages take
            about equal time (YMMV), but on larger cubes (4x4, 5x5 etc), the
            intuitive stage lasts longer. Personally, this is the part that I
            really enjoy and so I always preferred the larger cubes. I love
            <i>finding</i> a solution, not memorising one, so I know only about
            100 algorithms, where others would know far far more.

            the national top 10 in every category. (Well, to be honest, it was
            actually never that impressive. I just happened to be mediocre at a
            time when few others were. In Ireland ~2023, I was ranked second in
            4x4, third in 5x5 and 7x7, and I have earned four podiums at the
            Irish Championships.)

          <h3>Games and Puzzles</h3>
          <p>
            I am not a huge fan of computer games, buut there are a few that I
            really enjoy. My favourite is undoubtedly
            <a href="https://www.factorio.com/">Factorio</a>, which I cannot
            recommend enough. I still have't played the Space Age Expansion... I
            fear it would rob me of a month of my life. I have always loved
            Mincraft, but with every update it feels less and less familiar and
            cosy. I just want to punch trees, build a little tower and mine for
            diamonds :,(. Also played some REPO recently. (more people => more
            chaos => way more fun)
          </p>
          <p>
            I played a lot of chess with my father growing up, and even more
            with friends in university. I'm not actually much good at it though
            (~1400 ELO on Chess.com). A friend and I did go to one FIDE
            competition, and got smoked by some ten-year-old kids. We knew that
            would happen, but it was still a humbling exerience!
          </p>
          <p>
            I also enjoy Minesweeper, Sudoku, Kakuro, and some card games such
            as Poker, Durak.

          <h3>Running</h3>
          <p>
            Sometimes, when the urge to keep fit and get some fresh air
            motivates out the door, I enjoy running. I ran the 2024 Dublin Half
            Marathon, in something like 2:06. Next time, I hope for faster. Lets
            see if I train enough for it!
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Travel</h3>
          <p>
            Our world is vast and beautiful, and I can't wait to explore more of
            it. Unfortunately, my bank account insists I should have other
            priorities... If you are lucky, I will remember to post some photos
            here.
