      <h1>Under Construction!</h1>

      <p>
        Reading has always been a love of mine, but one that waxes and wanes. I
        remember reading many series before the pandemic (Harry Potter, The
        Hunger Games, Skulduggery Pleasant, The 39 Clues, The Demon Road
        Trilogy, The Song of Ice and Fire, etc.). However, as schoolwork piled
        up I found myself reading less and less for my own amusement. Since the
        final exams of my university career though, I have picked it back up I
        have kept track of my recent reading on
        <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/arfen?year=2025"
          >The Storygraph</a
        >, mainly for this graph:

      <p>
        I find it funny that my reading pace was a slow and constant crawl
        during term-time, then exploded in June and July as I procrastinated
        writing my thesis and felt desperate to read anything but math. The dip
        in August is due to the rush to finish and present the thesis, and the
        necessary recovery afterwards. I don't know what will happen next, only
        that there are enough books on my to-read list! Anyway, on this page are
        some books I particularly want to talk about, and then those that I have
        read recently.

      <h1>2025 Reading</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <h3><i>'The Picture of Dorian Gray'</i> — Oscar Wilde</h3>
          <p>
            As you have seen, the year started out pretty slow! I read
            <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> by Oscar Wilde across the first
            few months. Sadly, I found it much less
            <s>blatantly homosexual</s> provocative than I had
            <s>hoped for</s> been warned: it was famously used as evidence when
            he was put on trial for daring to be a homosexual in 1890's Dublin.
            I have since learned that there are three versions of this book: the
            original manuscript he sent to the magazine <i>Lippincott's</i>, the
            heavily-edited edition they published in 1890, and the further
            censored text Wilde eventually published as a book the next year.
            The third, most watered-down version is what survives as the most
            common one today, and is the one on my shelf. It was the previous,
            far more provocative versions which were used as evidence in his
            trial. I do recommend the book that I read, even as a thought
            exercise on hedonism and deceit, though I wish to read his original
            eventually!

        <li>
          <h3><i>'Meditations'</i> — Marcus Aurelius</h3>
          <p>
            After this I finally got around to reading <i>`Meditations'</i> by
            Marcus Aurelius, which has been on my reading list
            <b>since before I started university!</b>
            Oh well, better late than never. If you haven't heard of it, the
            book is a collection of private journals kept by the Roman Emperor
            as he was away on a war campaign. He would never return home, dying
            of a contagious disease, presumably the Antonine Plague. The
            joUrnals were not written with the aim to be published, but were
            personal exercises in Stoicism. He has since become the face of this
            philosophy, and his book its bible. That is what makes the words so
            meaningful, I find. They were not written by some self-help coach
            attempting to separate you from your money, but by a man striving to
            lead a virtuous life despite having been thrust into the most
            powerful position on the continent —
            <i
              >"Take care not to be Caesarified, or dyed in purple ... Strive
              hard to remain the same man that philosophy wished to make
              you."</i
            >, as he wrote (to himself!) in Book 6.

          <h3><i>'Remembrance of Earth's Past'</i> — Cixin Liu</h3>
          <p>
            REWRITE PLEASE!<br />
            Sometime in May, I was wandering a bookshop and came across
            <i>'The Three Body Problem'</i> by Cixin Liu, the first of his
            trilogy <i>'Remembrance of Earth's Past'</i>. I had seen the first
            Netflix adaptation of the first part of the story and strongly
            enjoyed it, so I was excited to read the book. It did not
            disappoint! I won't talk much about the plot, all you need to know
            is that mankind comes into contact with a far more advanced
            civilisation from Alpha Centauri, which in the book is a chaotic
            trinary star system. This civilisation (the Trisolarians) has
            launched an invasion fleet on a 400 year journey to conquer Earth,
            and we follow a Chinese physicist as the world freaks out at this
            news. <br />One thing I have huge respect for is how it deals with
            describing aliens. Most popular portrayals echo the antiquated
            belief that we were made in God's image: any intelligent species
            must look humanoid. Liu avoids this by giving essentially zero
            physical description of the aliens, apart from two pieces of
            information. First, they are able to dehydrate their bodies
            (reminiscent of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrades</a>)
            to survive extinction in the times where their planet is flung to
            far from, or comes too close to, one of their suns. Second, their
            thoughts show up as flashes of light on their skin. Thus, they have
            no distinction between 'to think' and 'to say', and no concept of
            deceit or lies. This is one way of avoiding the awkward question of
            'Why did the villain reveal his plan prematurely?', by designing the
            aliens to not realise that communication with the Earth was a
            strategic mistake. Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and in
            fact then read the second and third in quick succession. Each book
            starts in the 'present-day' (somewhere in the 2010's) and follows a
            separate character through the crisis. (The Netflix adaptation seems
            to cover the events chronologically, and includes the start of the
            second and third books.) The second book gets a bit slow in the
            middle, but the last 100-150 pages contain one of the most
            entertaining sequences of events I have ever read. I would recommend
            the series solely for those chapters. The book does not finish on a
            cliff-hanger per se, but resolves the main conflict and leaves many
            questions unanswered / open to interpretation, to the extent that I
            believe it possible to not read the final book.
          </p>

          <p>
            The third book is a slight disappointment by comparision. It tries
            to tie together such a huge story, that it falls into a common trap
            of such The story is still about as good, but the story-telling to
            science-fiction ratio becomes a little lopsided, (a symptom of
            having a huge conflict set in the future, we must introduce an
            unholy tree of technology) and as I said, That being said, the
            ending still made me cry, the technology introduced has given me
            countless hours of thought and conversation, and I still thoroughly
            enjoyed.
          </p>

          <p>
            As much as I did enjoy that series, it did suffer from one common
            symptom of such sci-fi epics: you cannot relate to the people (with
            the exception of Liu Ji of book 2). Every character lives and dies
            almost exactly the same as they were introduced. They do not have
            character arcs, only a sequence of events they live through. It is
            much harder to relate to a character who is stagnant and doesn't
            seem to work on their flaws; who is so shallow that they appear
            two-dimensional. This left a very dry taste in my mouth, so to
            speak, and with but amonth left until my thesis was due, I craved to
            read something where I could relate to a fucking character! Luckily
            for me, I had some of George Orwell's work sitting unread on my
            shelf.

          <h3>George Orwell</h3>
          <p>
            I had read both <i>'1984'</i> and <i>'Animal Farm'</i> a few years
            ago (on the recommendation of a friend at the time, for which I will
            always be grateful), and I had bought them as a set of 6 of Orwell's
            books. So, craving a story as much about a character as the unfair
            world they inhabit, this is where I turned. Over the course of a
            couple of weeks, I read both <i>'Keep the Aspidistra Flying'</i> and
            <i>'A Clergyman's Daughter'</i>. These are very similar books,
            following flawed characters as they navigate life on the brink of
            homelessness in an even-more-flawed London. They are very
            well-written, presumably because such was Orwell's own life at the
            time. The two situations were slightly different: the first
            character got there through his own self-destructive tendencies, the
            second through sheer misfortune (of being poor <b>and</b> a woman).
            These really hit the spot... I should read more Orwell in the
            future...

          <h3><i>'Hitch-22'</i> — Chritopher Hitchens</h3>
          <p>
            I am currently reading <i>'Hitch-22'</i>, the autobiography of
            Christopher Hitchens. I know Hitchens mainly as one of the 'Four
            Horsemen' of New Atheism, along with Dawkins, Dennett, and Harris.
            This is actually not too relevant to the autobiography, so I will
            comment on that elsewhere. I will write this later...
