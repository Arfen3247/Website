    <h1>Under Construction!</h1>

    <p>
      Reading has always been a love of mine, but one that waxes and wanes. I
      remember reading many series before the pandemic (Harry Potter, The Hunger
      Games, Skulduggery Pleasant, The 39 Clues, The Demon Road Trilogy, The
      Song of Ice and Fire, etc.). However, as schoolwork piled up I found
      myself reading less and less for my own amusement. Since the final exams
      of my university career, I have been reading far, far more. I have kept
      track of my recent reading on
      <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/arfen?year=2025"
        >The Storygraph</a
      >, mainly for this graph:

    <p>
      I find it funny that my reading pace was a slow and constant f<span
        class="centered-asterisk"
        >*</span
      >ck-all during term-time, then exploded in June and July as I
      procrastinated writing my thesis and was desperate to read anything but
      math. The dip in August is due to the rush to finish and present the
      thesis, and the necessary recovery afterwards. I don't know what will
      happen next, only that there are enough books on my to-read list! Anyway,
      on this page are some books I particularly want to talk about, and then
      those that I have read recently.

    <h1>2025 Reading</h1>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <h3><i>'The Picture of Dorian Gray'</i> — Oscar Wilde</h3>
        <p>
          As you have seen, the year started out pretty slow! I read
          <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> by Oscar Wilde across the first few
          months. Sadly, I found it much less
          <s>blatantly homosexual</s> provocative than I had
          <s>hoped for</s> been warned: it was famously used as evidence when he
          was put on trial for daring to be a homosexual in 1890's Dublin. I
          have since learned that there are three versions of this book: the
          original manuscript he sent to the magazine <i>Lippincott's</i>, the
          heavily-edited edition they published in 1890, and the further
          censored text Wilde eventually published as a book the next year. The
          third, most watered-down version is what survives as the most common
          one today, and is the one on my shelf. It was the previous, far more
          provocative versions which were used as evidence in his trial. I do
          recommend the book that I read, even as a thought exercise on hedonism
          and deceit, though I wish to read his original eventually!
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h3><i>'Meditations'</i> — Marcus Aurelius</h3>
        <p>
          After this I finally got around to reading <i>`Meditations'</i> by
          Marcus Aurelius, which has been on my reading list
          <b>since before I started university!</b>
          Oh well, better late than never. If you haven't heard of it, the book
          is a collection of private journals kept by the Roman Emperor as he
          was away on a war campaign. He would never return home, dying of a
          contagious disease, presumably the Antonine Plague. The jornals were
          not written with the aim to be published, but were personal exercises
          in Stoicism. He has since become the face of this philosophy, and his
          book its bible. That is what makes the words so meaningful, I find.
          They were not written by some self-help coach attempting to separate
          you from your money, but by a man striving to lead a virtuous life
          despite having been thrust into the most powerful position on the
          continent —
          <i
            >"Take care not to be Caesarified, or dyed in purple ... Strive hard
            to remain the same man that philosophy wished to make you."</i
          >, as he wrote (to himself!) in Book 6.

        <h3><i>'Remembrance of Earth's Past'</i> — Cixin Liu</h3>
        <p>
          Sometime in May, I was wandering a bookshop and came across
          <i>'The Three Body Problem'</i> by Cixin Liu, the first of his trilogy
          <i>'Remembrance of Earth's Past'</i>. I had seen the first Netflix
          adaptation of the first part of the story and strongly enjoyed it, so
          I was excited to read the book. It did not disappoint! I won't talk
          much about the plot, all you need to know is that mankind comes into
          contact with a far more advanced civilisation from Alpha Centauri,
          which in the book is a chaotic trinary star system. This civilisation
          (the Trisolarians) has launched an invasion fleet on a 400 year
          journey to conquer Earth, and we follow a Chinese physicist as the
          world freaks out at this news. <br />One thing I have huge respect for
          is how it deals with describing aliens. Most popular portrayals echo
          the antiquated belief that we were made in God's image: any
          intelligent species must look humanoid. Liu avoids this by giving
          essentially zero physical description of the aliens, apart from two
          pieces of information. First, they are able to dehydrate their bodies
          (reminiscent of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrades</a>) to
          survive extinction in the times where their planet is flung to far
          from, or comes too close to, one of their suns. Second, their thoughts
          show up as flashes of light on their skin. Thus, they have no
          distinction between 'to think' and 'to say', and no concept of deceit
          or lies. This is one way of avoiding the awkward question of 'Why did
          the villain reveal his plan prematurely?', by designing the aliens to
          not realise that communication with the Earth was a strategic mistake.
          <br />
          Anyway, I thoroughly enjoyed the book, and in fact then read the
          second and third in quick succession. Each book starts in the
          'present-day' (somewhere in the 2010's) and follows a separate
          character through the crisis. (The Netflix adaptation seems to cover
          the events chronologically, and includes the start of the second and
          third books.) The second book gets a bit slow in the middle, but the
          last 100-150 pages contain one of the most entertaining sequences of
          events I have ever read. I would recommend the series solely for those
          chapters. The book does not finish on a cliff-hanger per se, but
          resolves the main conflict and leaves many questions unanswered / open
          to interpretation, to the extent that I believe it possible to not
          read the final book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The third book is a slight disappointment by comparision. It tries to
          tie together such a huge story, that it falls into a common trap of
          such The story is still about as good, but the story-telling to
          science-fiction ratio becomes a little lopsided, (a symptom of having
          a huge conflict set in the future, we must introduce an unholy tree of
          technology) and as I said, That being said, the ending still made me
          cry, the technology introduced has given me countless hours of thought
          and conversation, and I still thoroughly enjoyed.
        </p>

        <p>
          As much as I did enjoy that series, it did suffer from one common
          symptom of such sci-fi epics: you cannot relate to the people (with
          the exception of Liu Ji of book 2). Every character lives and dies
          almost exactly the same as they were introduced. They do not have
          character arcs, only a sequence of events they live through. It is
          much harder to relate to a character who is stagnant and doesn't seem
          to work on their flaws; who is so shallow that they appear
          two-dimensional. This left a very dry taste in my mouth, so to speak,
          and with but amonth left until my thesis was due, I craved to read
          something where I could relate to a fucking character! Luckily for me,
          I had some of George Orwell's work sitting unread on my shelf.
        </p>

        <h3>
          <i>'Keep the Aspidistra Flying'</i>, <i>'A Clergyman's Daughter'</i> —
          George Orwell
        </h3>
        <p>
          I had read both <i>'1984'</i> and <i>'Animal Farm'</i> a few years ago
          (on the recommendation of a friend at the time, for which I will
          always be grateful), and I had bought them as a set of 6 of Orwell's
          books. So, craving a story as much about a character as the unfair
          world they inhabit, this is where I turned. Over the course of a
          couple of weeks, I read both <i>'Keep the Aspidistra Flying'</i> and
          <i>'A Clergyman's Daughter'</i>. These are very similar books,
          following flawed characters as they navigate life on the brink of
          homelessness in an even-more-flawed London. They are very
          well-written, presumably because such was Orwell's own life at the
          time. The two situations were slightly different: the first character
          got there through his own self-destructive tendencies, the second
          through sheer misfortune (of being poor <b>and</b> a woman). These
          really hit the spot... I should read more Orwell in the future...

        <h3><i>'Hitch-22'</i> — Chritopher Hitchens</h3>

        <p>
          I am currently reading <i>'Hitch-22'</i>, the autobiography of
          Christopher Hitchens. I know Hitchens mainly as one of the 'Four
          Horsemen' of New Atheism, along with Dawkins, Dennett, and Harris.
          This is actually not too relevant to the autobiography, so I will
          leave further comments on that in the later paragraphs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now back to how I discovered Hitchens. As do many young teenagers
          interested in physics, I slowly lost my faith. But in rural Ireland,
          where you were still judged, jokingly or not, for being the wrong
          flavour of Christian, I felt I had no-one to talk to about it. For
          example, it was not unheard of for the elderly Catholic relatives of
          someone marrying a Protestant to boycott the wedding. So, I turned to
          the Internet, where YouTube hosted a great many videos which picked
          apart religious arguments*. If you are interested, here are some
          creators:
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CosmicSkeptic">Alex O'Connor</a> (I
          think he went by Cosmic Skeptic at the time),
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GeneticallyModifiedSkeptic"
            >Genetically Modified Skeptic</a
          >,
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheAtheistExperience"
            >The Atheist Experience</a
          >
          (only up to the time
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@SansDeity">Matt Dillahunty</a>
          left),
          <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@professorstick">Professor Stick</a>.
          It wasn't too long then until I can across the four great writers and
          orators of the New Atheism movement, of which Hitchens is probably the
          most well-known. For better or for worse, my dislike of organised
          religion (part of a wider hatred of any undemocratic concentration of
          power which is a net negative on society: <b>Fuck the Church</b>,
          <b><s>Eat</s> Tax the Rich</b>, <b>Melt Down The Crown</b> and so
          forth) was largely shaped by Hitchens, and the views expressed so
          wonderfully in his magnum opus <i>'God is not Great'</i>, which I got
          around to reading last summer.

          *Unfortunate tangent time. Many such channels thrived by making viral
          moments (duh). The more aggregious (not those listed above) would find
          clips making poor arguments to defend some claim, and debunk these
          instead of a more sound argument. Effectively, finding a strawman
          instead of making one. This is fairly easy, and mostly harmless, to do
          for religious beliefs (which, to my knowledge, have precisely zero
          sound defence) and many conspiracy theories (some of which are
          defensible, others less so). The problem is that some did this to
          other (mostly liberal) political beliefs — there was a seemingly
          bottomless pit of 'modern feminists' and 'social justice warriors', or
          rather strawmen of these, on which they preyed. For someone like me,
          (young, politically uneducated, impressionable), such content
          unfortunately presented a very one-sided view of the world: the right
          were merely 'protecting traditional values', while the left were
          'uneducated extremists'... I shudder at the thought of who I could
          have been indoctrinated into becoming. Don't worry, I had seen the
          light by the time I went to university (though I am still
          embarrasingly uneducated in many political matters). For more on the
          atheist-to-alt-right pipeline that was present on YouTube in the
          mid-to-late 2010's, please see

          fantastic discussion.
