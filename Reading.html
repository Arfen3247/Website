        Reading has always been a love of mine, but one that waxes and wanes. I
        remember reading many series before the pandemic (Harry Potter, The
        Hunger Games, Skulduggery Pleasant, The 39 Clues, The Demon Road
        Trilogy, The Song of Ice and Fire, etc.). However, as schoolwork piled
        up I found myself reading less and less for my own amusement. I did read
        a little throughout university, but have really picked it back up since.
        I have kept track of my recent reading on
        <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/stats/arfen?year=2025"
          >The Storygraph</a
        >, mainly for this graph:

        I find the spike in June/July very funny. This was me procrastinating
        from writing my thesis and feeling desperate to read anything but math.
        Anyway, on this page are some books I particularly want to talk about,
        and then those that I have read recently.

          <h3><i>'The Picture of Dorian Gray'</i> — Oscar Wilde</h3>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion_panel">
          <p>
            This book was my slow start to 2025, taking 3 months to finish
            despite being about 200 pages long. (I always struggled to find time
            to read during term-time). Sadly, I found it much less
            <s>blatantly homosexual</s> provocative than I had
            <s>hoped for</s> been warned: it was famously used as evidence when
            he was put on trial for daring to be a homosexual in 1890's Dublin.
            I have since learned that there are three versions of this book: the
            original manuscript he sent to the magazine <i>Lippincott's</i>, the
            heavily-edited edition they published in 1890, and the further
            censored text Wilde eventually published as a book the next year.
            The third, most watered-down version is what survives as the most
            common one today, and is the one on my shelf. It was the previous,
            far more provocative versions which were used as evidence in his
            trial. I do recommend the book that I read, even as a thought
            exercise on hedonism and deceit, though I wish to read his original
            eventually!

          <h3><i>'Meditations'</i> — Marcus Aurelius</h3>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion_panel">
          <p>
            After this I finally got around to reading <i>`Meditations'</i> by
            Marcus Aurelius, which has been on my reading list
            <b>since before I started university!</b>
            Oh well, better late than never. If you haven't heard of it, the
            book is a collection of private journals kept by the Roman Emperor
            as he was away on a war campaign. He would never return home, dying
            of a contagious disease, presumably the Antonine Plague. The
            journals were not written with the aim to be published, but were
            personal exercises in Stoicism. He has since become the face of this
            philosophy, and this book its bible. That is what makes the words so
            meaningful, I find. They were not written by some self-help coach
            attempting to separate you from your money, but by a man striving to
            lead a virtuous life despite having been thrust into the most
            powerful position on the continent —
            <i
              >"Take care not to be Caesarified, or dyed in purple ... Strive
              hard to remain the same man that philosophy wished to make
              you."</i
            >, as he wrote (to himself!) in Book 6.

          <h3><i>'Remembrance of Earth's Past'</i> — Cixin Liu</h3>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion_panel">
          <p>
            This is a science-fiction trilogy which is being adapted by Netflix
            under the name <i>'The Three-Body Problem'</i>, the first season of
            which I really enjoyed. These books account for the June/July spike
            in my reading. Each book starts in the 'present-day' (somewhere in
            the 2010's) and follows a separate character through 'The Crisis',
            each going further into the future than the last. (The Netflix
            adaptation seems to cover the events chronologically, including the
            start of the second and third books.)
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3><i>'The Three Body Problem'</i></h3>
              <p>
                I won't talk much about the plot, all you need to know is that
                mankind comes into contact with a far more advanced alien
                civilisation from Alpha Centauri, which in the book is a chaotic
                trinary star system. This civilisation, the Trisolarians, has
                launched an invasion fleet on a 400 year journey to conquer
                Earth. Understandably, those who know are freaking out. I will
                comment more at the end, but this rendition of aliens is the
                best i have ever read, and most of the sci-fi is believable and
                enjoyable.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3><i>'The Dark Forest'</i></h3>
            </li>
            <p>
              The second book gets a bit slow in the middle, but the last
              100-150 pages contain one of the most entertaining sequences of
              events I have ever read.
              <span class="spoiler"
                >The Droplets! The Battle of Darkness!! So good!!!</span
              >
              I would recommend the series solely for those chapters. The book
              does not finish on a cliff-hanger per se, but resolves the main
              conflict and leaves many questions unanswered / open to
              interpretation, to the extent that I believe it possible to not
              read the final book and be mostly satisfied.
            </p>

            <li>
              <h3><i>'Death's End'</i></h3>
            </li>
            <p>
              The final book has similar strengths to the previous, but in my
              opinion is a slight disappointment by comparison for a reason I'll
              discuss later. It tries to tie together such a huge story, set far
              into the future, so introduces an unholy tree of technology. While
              some tech is introduced that leads to no plot development, those
              which are used to their full potential make up for it and the
              ratio of story-telling to science-fiction is still quite good. The
              sci-fi becomes harder to take seriously though. Spoiler:
              <span class="spoiler"
                >Space of a different dimension than 3, and more scarily, their
                weaponisation.</span
              >
              That being said, the ending still made me cry, and the technology
              introduced has given me countless hours of thought and
              conversation, and I thoroughly enjoyed.
            </p>

            <p>
              However, I felt there was one major weakness in the final book
              that I didn't notice in the other two. It suffered from a pitfall
              common to many such sci-fi epics: the characters are not properly
              developed. Every character lives and dies almost exactly the same
              as they were introduced. They do not have character arcs, only a
              sequence of events they live through. It is much harder to relate
              to a character who is stagnant and doesn't seem to work on their
              flaws, who is so shallow that they appear two-dimensional. This
              left a very dry taste in my mouth, so to speak. It left me craving
              a book where I could relate to a character as a fellow flawed
              human. Fortunately, I had some George Orwell unread on my shelf...
            </p>
          </ul>

          <p>
            One thing I have huge respect for is the description of the aliens.
            Most popular portrayals echo the antiquated belief that we were made
            in God's image: <i>'any intelligent species must look humanoid'</i>.
            Liu avoids this by giving essentially zero physical description of
            the aliens, apart from two pieces of information necessary for the
            plot. First, they are able to dehydrate their bodies (reminiscent of
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tardigrade">tardigrades</a>)
            to survive extinction in the times where their planet is flung too
            far from, or comes too close to, one of their suns. This dangerous
            situation is why they are planning on conquering the Earth. Second,
            their thoughts show up as flashes of light on their skin. Thus, they
            have no distinction between 'to think' and 'to say', and no concept
            of deceit or lies. This is one way of avoiding the awkward question
            of 'Why did the villain reveal his plan prematurely?', by designing
            the aliens to not realise that communication with the Earth was a
            strategic mistake.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also, much of the science fiction, especially in the first two
            books, is actually not terrible, leading to some very interesting
            stories without making my inner physicist cringe.
            <span class="spoiler">Oh my god the droplets were so good!!!</span>
            With the exception of the sophons: faster-than-light communication
            through quantum entanglement. Yuck. But the story is what it is
            because it allows for communication between the civilisations, so it
            is a necessary evil. As I said, the third book is a bit further
            out...
          </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion_cover">
          <h3>George Orwell</h3>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion_panel">
          <p>
            I had read both <i>'1984'</i> and <i>'Animal Farm'</i> a few years
            ago (on the recommendation of a friend at the time, for which I will
            always be grateful), and I had bought them as a set of 6 of Orwell's
            books. After finishing the sci-fi trilogy above, which as I said
            made me want to read a story as much about a character as the unfair
            world they inhabit, this is where I turned.
          </p>
          <p>
            Over late July and early August, I read both
            <i>'Keep the Aspidistra Flying'</i> and
            <i>'A Clergyman's Daughter'</i>. These are very similar books,
            following flawed characters as they navigate life on the brink of
            homelessness in an even-more-flawed London. They are very
            well-written, presumably because such was Orwell's own life at the
            time. The two situations were slightly different though: the first
            character got there through his own self-destructive tendencies, the
            second through sheer misfortune (of being poor <b>and</b> a woman).
          </p>
          <p>
            I would not recommend these as much as <i>'1984'</i> and
            <i>'Animal Farm'</i>, but they were easy to digest and I enjoyed
            them.
          </p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion_cover">
          <h3><i>'Hitch-22'</i> — Chritopher Hitchens</h3>
        </button>
        <div class="accordion_panel">
          <p>
            This is the memoir of Christopher Hitchens (1949-2011), a
            Britich-American journalist and writer. I know him mainly as one of
            the 'Four Horsemen' of New Atheism, along with Dawkins, Dennett, and
            Harris. This is actually not too relevant to the autobiography, so I
            will comment on that <a href="template.html">elsewhere</a>. I won't
            talk much about who he was, but here are a few reasons why I really
            enjoyed the book. Firstly, it was a great experience, to learn more
            reasons to respect someone I already held in high regard. For
            example, he was active in far more arenas of politics than I had
            known, being quite the socialist, and extremely anti-war when he was
            younger.
          </p>
          <p>
            Secondly, this is the only 'memoir' I have ever read; any other
            autobiographical work I have read are by much younger people with
            decades to look forward to. It is quite something to step inside the
            mind of someone who knows they have lived most of their life, and is
            seeing their peers in the obituaries. Hitchens would die the next
            year of oesophageal cancer, not yet detected at the time of
            publication. During his treatment, he started writing a sequel,
            '<i>Mortality</i>', which ends abruptly with a sketch of another
            chapter, and an afterword by his wife (which has succeeded in making
            me cry every damn time I open the page). Death of the kind seen
            coming (terminal illness, suicide, self-sacrifice) is something that
            always makes me emotional. On a completely unrelated note, I am
            reminded to rewatch
            <i>'Only the Brave'</i>, based on
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yarnell_Hill_Fire"
              >a harrowing true story</a
            >.
          </p>

          <p>
            And the final, most impactful reason is this. He came of university
            age in the late 1960's. Throughout his youth, the rhetoric on
            international war was the condemnation of what had happened twice in
            a lifetime, the strong urging for countries to co-operate and live
            peacefully and so on. Then, as he entered university in the 1960's,
            there were 500,000 American military personnel in Vietnam, and
            100,000 Warsaw Pact military personnel in Czechoslovakia... What a
            load of shite all that talk had turned out to be! (<i
              >I wonder what that must feel like...
            </i>
            I don't think there is need to explain the parallels to the world we
            find ourselves in now.) He speaks briefly on the anger that arose
            from the sudden realisations that the decades-long anti-war talk was
            meaningless, that the government of your great nation was complicit
            in atrocities overseas, and that the horrors previous generations
            witnessed were happening again. To see, written down, the anger of
            someone going through what we are was eye-opening, though it
            probably shouldn't have been. How naive we are to believe the world
            has changed.
