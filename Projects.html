        <h3>Master's Thesis — Kernel Density Estimation</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          In the summer of 2025 I completed a research project in Mathematics as
          the last third of my Master's degree. This consisted of a
          <a href="Files/Projects/MSc_Thesis_Adam.pdf">thesis</a> and a
          <a href="Files/Projects/MSc_Presentation_Adam.pdf">presentation</a>.
          For this, I studied Kernel Density Estimation. This is a method in
          non-parametric statistics to recover a probability density function
          from a sample, without placing restrictive assumptions on the density.
          In particular, I studied the convergence rates of these estimators,
          under some regularity assumptions on the density. The thesis is split
          into two parts. The first explores the problem in the classic setting,
          on the real line, and follows
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b13794">this book</a>
          by Tsybakov. The second half considers the problem on more general
          metric spaces and catches up to some modern research done by my
          supervisor
          <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/galatiacleanthous/home"
            >Dr. Galatia Cleanthous</a

          and her collaborators. This project earned a grade of 91%.

        <h3>Undergraduate II — Thermal Creation of Solitons</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          In 2024 (the third year of my undergraduate), my classmate
          <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/cillian-grall/">Cillian Grall</a>
          and I completed a project on the thermal creation of
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton"> solitons</a>. These
          are long-surviving, localised, non-linear wave-packets that appear in
          a scalar field subject to a multi-welled potential, where part of the
          field spills into another well. Our setting is some scalar field
          \(\phi(\vec{x},t)\) subject to the wave equation and a potential well
          \(V(\phi)\),$$ \frac{\partial^2\phi}{\partial t^2} = \nabla^2\phi -
          \frac{d V}{d\phi}.$$ We focused on the simplest case, a
          one-dimensional scalar field \(\phi\) with a double-welled quartic
          potential \(V(\phi)=\lambda(\phi^2-1)^2\), where \(\lambda\) is a
          coupling parameter. The system was discretised and subjected to
          periodic boundary conditions. This discretised system then acts as a
          pearl necklace, with each pearl moving with its own speed, being
          pulled down the walls of the potential, and tugging on its neighbours.
          Adding enough energy in the system allows some section of the necklace
          to cross the divide into the other well. This forms a large wave in
          the field whcih survives until the pearls happen to spill back over —
          a soliton! For a range of temperatures, the system was initialised
          using a
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">
            Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a
          >
          approach, called the Heat Bath Algorithm. (This was quite difficult,
          and I am still hugely proud of it.) The system was then evolved simply
          using the finite difference method, and the creation rate of solitons
          was calculated, and graphed against temperature. The code can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/Arfen3247/Solitons">here</a>, and the
          report <a href="Files/Projects/Kink_Anti_kink_creation.pdf">here</a>.
          This project earned a grade of 87%.

        <h3>Undergraduate I — The Chaotic Inflationary Universe</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          In 2023 (the second year of my undergraduate), my classmates

          and I completed a project on the inflation of the early universe.
          There are properties of our universe which seem unlikely, such as its
          apparent flatness, but become credible if the universe underwent a
          huge spatial growth in a short period of time. This idea is called
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation"
            >Cosmic Inflation</a
          >. It is estimated that at least 60 e-folds of inflation must have
          occurred. That is to say, points in space 1 unit apart would be
          separated by \(e^{60}\approx 10^{26}\) units after some finite time.
          Quite a lot! If we pick a pair of points in space, and track the
          distance between them over time, calling this function the cosmic
          scale factor \(a(t)\), we can interpret this as a measure of the
          universe's size over time. In this project, we assumed a flat universe
          dominated by a scalar field \(\phi(t)\), obeying the Friedman and
          Klein-Gordon equations, $$H := \frac{\dot{a}}{a} =
          C\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)}, \qquad
          \ddot{\phi}+3H\dot{\phi}+\frac{dV}{d\phi}=0,$$where
          \(C=M_p^{-1}\sqrt{8\pi/3}\) and \(M_p\) is the Planck length. We focus
          on the simplest potential, the quadratic well
          \(V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m^2\phi^2\). The Friedman equation causes \(a\)
          to increase rapidly when \(\phi\) or \(\dot{\phi}\) are large. The
          Klein-Gordon equation causes \(\phi\) to act roughly like a damped
          oscillator, and decay towards the minimum of \(V\). Together, these
          causes \(\phi\) to slowly settle towards the minimum and \(a\) to grow
          until that time. This leads to a finite period of time where intense
          growth is observed — cosmic inflation! Choosing some inital conditions
          of \(\phi\) and \(\dot{\phi}\), the system can be evolved over time
          (using an ODE solver) to see how much inflation occurs. In this
          project, we explored which initial conditions of led to a sufficient
          amount of inflation, finding this is easier than expected under our
          simple model. We also attempted to study the impact of the mass
          parameter \(m\), and even some different potentials \(V\). The Python
          code can be found
          <a href="https://github.com/Arfen3247/Chaotic-Inflation">here</a>, and
          the report
          <a href="Files/Projects/Chaotic_Inflation_Report.pdf">here</a>.
          Looking back on it now, this project <s>was quite crap</s> could have
          been done better. But it was our first, so don't judge it too harshly!

          My ongoing project, starting August 2025, is making
          <a href="https://adamfurlong.me/">my own website</a>. It will be a
          place for me to talk about things I like, mainly some
          <a href="https://adamfurlong.me/Projects.html">Projects</a> of mine
          such as <a href="https://adamfurlong.me/">my website</a>.

          Hilarious self-references aside, this has been a really fun project.
          <a href="https://github.com/Arfen3247/Website">Here</a> is the
          repository, if you interested in how it works. It started as a theft
          of <a href="https://www.patrykdrozd.fun/">my friend's website</a>,
          because his is pretty cool (and I liked the colour cheme). It is
          hosted for free using GitHub Pages. The only cost would be getting
          your own personalised domain name. I got mine from
          <a href="https://porkbun.com/">here</a>, for about 20 euro a year, but
          there are many such sites. As I build more of it, I might have more to
          say...

        The following are 'ready' soon, I am in the process of writing them up.
        These are just some recreational math problems, that I try to solve
        using some questionable python code.

        <h3>A Numberplate Game</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          Here is a game a friend taught me on the drive to university, that
          spawned some questions I answered by using python.
        </p>
        <h3>The Game</h3>
        <p>
          A <b>digit string</b> is an ordered list of numbers (integers from 0
          to 9 in our case), such as 15397. This is not to be interpreted as
          fifteen thousand three hundred and ninety seven, but as one followed
          by five, three, nine, and seven.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(1\times (5-3)+9\div 7\) is an <b>expression</b> of the digit string
          15397. Between the digits we place some operation from addition,
          subtraction, multiplication and division. We are allowed to use an
          operation as many times as we like (including not at all), to use as
          many parentheses as we like, but we cannot reorder the digits and
          every two digits must have an operation between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <b>solution</b> of the digit string is some expression that
          evaluates to zero. Note that \(9-9\), \(1+2-3\), \(8-2\times 4\) and
          \(2-6\div (1+2)\) are solutions of 99, 123, 824 and 2612 respectively.
          Clearly any digit string which contains a zero can be solved using
          only multiplications. Eg. \(5\times0\times3\) is a solution of 503.
          \(1\times (5-3)+9\div 7\) is clearly not a solution to 15397, but can
          you find one? <span class="spoiler">\((1+5+3-9)\times7\)</span>
        </p>
        <p>
          Given some source of digit strings, the game is to be the first to
          find a solution. For example, Irish vehicle registration plates
          (numberplates) take the form 162-D-15397. On the drive to university,
          we would play the game on the other cars around us. I won slightly
          more often (he was driving).
        </p>
        <h3>The Question</h3>
        <p>
          Firstly, how many digit strings can be solved? This answer is quite
          clearly infinity. Since 11 is solvable, so is anything that contains
          11, such as 4627115, of which there are infinitely many. The second
          question is less obvious.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some strings cannot be solved. For example, 1, 12, 124, 8985. How many
          cannot be solved? As strings get longer, it becomes easier to solve
          them, so we expect the unsolvable strings to get increasingly rare.
          But, are there only finitely many of them? If so, what is the largest
          of them?
        </p>
        <h3>
          The Project — will be put <a href="Projects/Numberplate.html">here</a>
        </h3>
        <p>
          I try to solve the above problem with some python code, just using a
          brute force approach. After that, I come up with a slightly larger
          problem. Solving this requires more efficient approaches, such as
          using a Breadth-First Search over a Trie stuctrure. All coming soon!
