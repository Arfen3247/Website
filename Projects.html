        At the bottom of the page I discuss some projects completed for my
        Bachelors and Masters. Before that, I'll link some projects of my own.
        For now, these are all works in progress.

          <h3>Rubik's Cube — Last Layer Lunatics</h3>
          <p><b>ETA</b>: October, this is not a priority lol</p>
          <p>
            While I am no longer a speedcuber, from time to time I still fidget
            with and think about Rubik's cubes. The last step in many method of
            solving the cube is the last layer. There are in essence 4
            objectives: to orient and permute the corners and edges. While more
            advanced methods can complete more than one of these objectives in
            single stages, many beginner's methods are split into these 4
            stages, using some algorithm to complete each. This is called
            '4-look last layer', or 4LLL, and is really the minimum number of
            algorithms required to solve the cube. These algorithms essentially
            give a directed graph structure to the set of states of the last
            layer. A true beginner may not know how to efficiently traverse this
            graph, and may choose paths which loop back on themselves. With
            experience, one learns to distinguish between these states. However,
            by this time, one learns more algorithms to deal with these cases in
            a more efficient way, moving towards a faster 2LLL method and
            removing the need for efficient graph traversal. My question is then
            this rather unimportant one: how move-efficient can you get using
            only the 4LLL algorithms? On this graph structure they define, what
            are the optimal paths to the solved state, and what is the average
            number of moves required? Answering these questions can be done
            using a Breadth-First Search backwards from the solved state, which
            can be implemented in a quick python script...

          <h3>VAMPs — Violators of A Monotonic Property</h3>
          <p>
            I was feeling particularly like a cosmologist when I named this. For
            a family of enumeration problems, constructs an algorithm based on a
            Trie structure, which has significantly improved time complexity at
            the cost of storing the structure. (Useless in practice, as the main
            ceiling for such problems is the space complecity, but I find it
            interesting in theory).

            Coming soon, but for now, can <i>you</i> figure out what these
            numbers have in common??

            This is an 'efficient' way of storing the strings
            1,2,3,12,13,21,23,31,32,131,212,232,313,323, but there is a better
            reason later. Note that '323' is on the tree, and so is '23'...

          <h3>Postgraduate — Kernel Density Estimation</h3>
          <p>
            In the summer of 2025 I completed a research project in Mathematics
            as the last third of my Master's degree. This consisted of a
            <a href="Files/Projects/MSc_Thesis_Adam.pdf">thesis</a> and a
            <a href="Files/Projects/MSc_Presentation_Adam.pdf">presentation</a>.
            For this, I studied Kernel Density Estimation. This is a method in
            non-parametric statistics to recover a probability density function
            from a sample, without placing restrictive assumptions on the
            density. In particular, I studied the convergence rates of these
            estimators, under some regularity assumptions on the density. The
            thesis is split into two parts. The first explores the problem in
            the classic setting, on the real line, and follows
            <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/b13794"
              >this book</a
            >
            by Tsybakov. The second half considers the problem on more general
            metric spaces and catches up to some modern research done by my
            supervisor
            <a href="https://sites.google.com/site/galatiacleanthous/home"

            and her collaborators. This project earned a grade of 91%.

          <h3>Undergraduate II — Thermal Creation of Solitons</h3>
          <p>
            In 2024 (the third year of my undergraduate), my classmate
            <a href="people.html">Cillian Grall</a> and I completed a project on
            the thermal creation of solitons. These are long-surviving,
            localised, non-linear wave-packets that appear in a scalar field
            subject to a multi-welled potential, where part of the field spills
            into another well. We focused on the simplest case, a
            one-dimensional scalar field \(\phi\) with a double-welled quartic
            potential \(V(\phi)=\lambda(\phi^2-1)^2\), where \(\lambda\) is a
            coupling parameter. The system was discretised and subjected to
            periodic boundary conditions. For a range of temperatures, the
            system was initialised using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain_Monte_Carlo">
              Markov Chain Monte Carlo</a
            >
            approach, called the Heat Bath Algorithm. (This was quite difficult,
            and I am still hugely proud of it.) The system was then evolved
            simply using the finite difference method, and the creation rate of
            solitons was calculated, and graphed against temperature. The code
            can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/Arfen3247/Solitons">here</a>, and the
            report
            <a href="Files/Projects/Kink_Anti_kink_creation.pdf">here</a>. This
            project earned a grade of 87%.

          <h3>Undergraduate I — The Chaotic Inflationary Universe</h3>
          <p>
            In 2023 (the second year of my undergraduate), my classmates
            <a href="people.html">Cillian Grall</a>,
            <a href="people.html">Ciaran McNamara</a> and I completed a project
            on the inflation of the early universe. There are properties of our
            universe which seem unlikely, such as its apparent flatness, but
            become credible if the universe underwent a huge spatial growth in a
            short period of time. This idea is called
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_inflation"
              >Cosmic Inflation</a
            >. It is estimated that at least 60 e-folds of inflation must have
            occurred. That is to say, points in space 1 unit apart would be
            separated by \(e^{60}\approx 10^{26}\) units after some finite time.
            Quite a lot! If we pick a pair of points in space, and track the
            distance between them over time, calling this function the cosmic
            scale factor \(a(t)\), we can interpret this as a measure of the
            universe's size over time. In this project, we assumed a
            one-dimensional universe of no spatial curvature and dominated by a
            scalar field \(\phi(x,t)\). We also assumed the Friedman and
            Klein-Gordon equations, $$H := \frac{\dot{a}}{a} =
            C\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}\dot{\phi}^2 + V(\phi)}, \qquad
            \ddot{\phi}+3H\dot{\phi}+\frac{dV}{d\phi}=0,$$ are satisified, where
            \(C=M_p^{-1}\sqrt{\frac{8\pi}{3}}\) and \(M_p\) is the Planck
            length. We focus on the simplest potential, the quadratic well
            \(V(\phi)=\frac{1}{2}m\phi^2\). The Friedman equation causes \(a\)
            to increase rapidly when \(\phi\) or \(\dot{\phi}\) are large. The
            Klein-Gordon equation causes \(\phi\) to act roughly like a damped
            oscillator, and decay towards the minimum of \(V\). Together, these
            causes \(\phi\) to slowly settle towards the minimum and \(a\) to
            grow until that time. This leads to a finite period of time where
            intense growth is observed — cosmic inflation! Choosing some inital
            conditions of \(\phi\) and \(\dot{\phi}\), the system can be evolved
            over time (using an ODE solver) to see how much inflation occurs. In
            this project, we explored which initial conditions of led to a
            sufficient amount of inflation, finding this is easier than expected
            under our simple model. We also attempted to study the impact of the
            mass parameter \(m\), and even some different potentials \(V\). The
            Python code can be found
            <a href="https://github.com/Arfen3247/Chaotic-Inflation">here</a>,
            and the report
            <a href="Files/Projects/Chaotic_Inflation_Report.pdf">here</a>.
            Looking back on it now, this project <s>was quite crap</s> could
            have been done better. This was in our second year, so don't judge
            it too harshly!
