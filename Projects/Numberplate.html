      <h1>The Numberplate Game</h1>
      <p>
        Here is a game a friend taught me on the drive to university, that gave
        me many hours of entertainment. To illustrate it, let me lay out some
        definitions:
      </p>
      <button class="accordion_cover">
        <h2>Definitions</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          A <u>digit string</u> is an ordered list of numbers (integers from 0
          to 9 in our case), such as 15397. This is not to be interpreted as
          fifteen thousand three hundred and ninety seven, but as one followed
          by five, three, nine, and seven.
        </p>
        <p>
          \(1\times (5-3)+9\div 7\) is an <u>expression</u> of the digit string
          15397. Between the digits we place some operation from addition,
          subtraction, multiplication and division. We are allowed to use an
          operation as many times as we like (including not at all), to use as
          many parentheses as we like, but we cannot reorder the digits and
          every two digits must have an operation between them.
        </p>
        <p>
          A <u>solution</u> of the digit string is some expression that
          evaluates to zero. \(9-9\), \(1+2-3\), \(8-2\times 4\) and \(2-6\div
          (1+2)\) are solutions of 99, 123, 824 and 2612 respectively. Clearly
          any digit string which contains a zero can be solved using only
          multiplications. Eg. \(5\times0\times3\) is a solution of
          503.\(1\times (5-3)+9\div 7\) is clearly not a solution to 15397, but
          can you find one?
          <span class="spoiler">\((1+5+3-9)\times7\)</span> Can you solve
          194878? <span class="spoiler">No. You can't. It is impossible.</span>
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Given some source of digit strings, the game is to be the first to find
        a solution. For example, Irish vehicle registration plates
        (numberplates) take the form 251-WX-13946, so you can use the last
        section of digits. Can you solve this one?
        <span class="spoiler">I'll show you later ;)</span>
        On the drive to university, my friend and I would play the game on the
        other cars around us. I like to think I won slightly more often (he was
        driving).
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h1>The Question</h1>
      <p>
        Now that you know the game, let me introduce the very interesting
        question:
      </p>
      <h2>How many digit strings are solvable?</h2>
      <p>
        Just kidding, the answer to this is clearly infinitely many. We can
        solve 11, by using the expression 1-1. Then we can solve any expression
        containing 11. For example, $abc11xyz$ is solved by $a\times b\times
        c\times (1-1)\times x\times y\times z$. This is an infinite family of
        digit strings which have a solution. Among them are 11, 111, 1111,
        11111, 111111, 1111111 etc.
      </p>
      <h2>How many digit strings are not solvable?</h2>
      <p>
        This is a far less trivial question. Clearly, as we consider longer and
        longer strings, it becomes harder for them to not have a solution.
        Indeed, it can be easily shown that the fraction of digit strings of
        length $L$ which are not solvable tends to 0 as $L$ grows.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not obvious, however, if there are finitely many or infinitely
        many unsolvables. To illustrate this a little, let me show you a similar
        property. A square is a digit string of the form $'XX'$ for some string
        $'X'$. For example, $11$, $2323$ and $97349734$ are squares, but $23$
        and $223$ are not. A string is called square-free if none of its
        substrings are a square. For example, 1, 23531 and 976975 are
        square-free, but $223$ and $976769$ are not. Similar to the property we
        are interested in, as $L$ grows, square-free strings of length $L$
        become exceedingly rare. However, it is known that there are infinitely
        many square-free strings (as long as you allow more than 2 characters).
        To learn more about square-free numbers, see
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-free_word"
          >this Wikipedia article</a
        >, <a href="https://oeis.org/A006156">this OEIS page</a>
        and links therein.
      </p>
      <p>
        After some thinking though, I can assure you that there are finitely
        many. If the length of a digit string is 20 or more, then I guarantee it
        is solvable.
      </p>
      <button class="accordion_cover">
        <h2>Proof of Finiteness</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          Coming soon. Actually is not essential though, given the 'When have we
          found them all?' section, because if our program terminates, we have
          found them all, and so there are finitely many.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        With this knowledge, we know that we need only check numbers up to
        $10^{20}$. This is a huge ceiling, which is not too helpful. But, in
        principle this is a finite search space. Also, we will be able to tell
        if we finish early.
      </p>
      <button class="accordion_cover">
        <h2>When have we found them all?</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          For each $L>0$, $U(L)$ denotes the number of digit strings of length
          $L$ that are not solvable. The idea is we calculate $U(1)$, then
          $U(2), U(3)$ and so on.
        </p>
        <h3>When $U(L)=0$</h3>
        <p>
          This means that any digit string of length $L$ has a solution. Take
          any digit string of length $>L$. It has a substring which has length
          $L$, for example its first $L$ digits. But this substring has a
          solution, and so the string is solvable. Thus no string of length $>L$
          is solvable, so we are finished.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thus if we, for each successive length, count how many strings of that
          length cannot be solved, we can stop searching once we reach a length
          for which the counter is zero. We haved proved above this will happen
          no later than length 20, but hopefully sooner! Also, there is another
          way we may stop...
        </p>
        <h3>When $U(L)=1$</h3>
        <p>
          This means that only one digit string of length $L$ cannot be solved.
          Take any digit string of length $>L$. It has (at least) two substrings
          of length $L$: the ones starting at the first digit and the second
          digit. There are two possibilities: both them are the unsolvable of
          length $L$, or otherwise. If otherwise, then at least one of them is
          not that unsolvable, so has a solution. Then the string would have a
          solvable substring, so is solvable itself. But if both of them are the
          unsolvable of length $L$, then their first digits match. Then the
          first two digits of the string are equal, so the string is solvable.
          Thus no string of length $>L$ is solvable and we are done.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        Together, these facts justify trying a brute force approach â€” just check
        every digit string!

      <h1>Chapter 0: Finding Expressions</h1>
      <p>
        If you are skimming this page, you can skip this section. All you need
        to know is that I have a python script to produce the expressions, and I
        know roughly how many there will be.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this section is to find all of the expressions for a string
        of length $L$. We denote the number of these by $E(L)$, and I am curious
        how fast this grows.... Let's start by listing out some small
        expressions.
      </p>

      <button class="accordion_cover">
        <h2>How many expressions are there for small $L$?</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          We denote a string of length $L$ as being the first $L$ letters of the
          alphabet. Clearly $E(1)=1$ as $a$ is the only expression of the string
          $a$. There is no space to place an operation!
        </p>
        <p>Here are the $E(2)=4$ of a string of length 2:</p>
        $$ a+b, a-b, a\times b, a\div b$$
        <p>
          And here are the $E(3)=24$ of a string of length 3. Check that you
          agree.
        </p>
        <pre class="mathjax-process">
$$\begin{align} 
&a+b+c &&a+b-c &&&a+b\times c &&&&a+b\div c \\ 
&a-b+c &&a-b-c &&&a-b\times c &&&&a-b\div c \\ 
&a\times b+c &&a\times b-c &&&a\times b\times c &&&&a\times b\div c \\

&a\div (b+c) &&a\div (b-c) &&&(a+b)\div c &&&&(a- b)\div c
\end{align} $$
</pre
        >

        <p>
          However we see there is a lot of redundancy in this listing. Everytime
          $+$ appears, there is another string that is identical except that $+$
          is replaced by $-$, and vice verasa. The same is true for the pair
          $\times, \div$. Removing all of the expressions with $-$ or $\div$, we
          cut down the list by a factor of $2^{L-1}$, a factor of two for each
          of the $L-1$ operations. So, we can write the above lists more
          compactly as:
        </p>
        <pre class="mathjax-process">
$$\begin{align}
&L=1 &&L=2 &&&L=3 \\
&a &&a+b &&&a+b+c \\
& &&a\times b &&&a+b\times c \\
& && &&&a\times b+ c \\
& && &&&(a+b)\times c \\
& && &&&a\times (b+ c) \\
& && &&&a\times b\times c 
\end{align}$$
</pre
        >
        <p>
          You can get back the original lists by including the copies of these
          with various numbers of $+$ and $\times$ replaced with $-$ and $\div$.
          Using just $+$ and $\times$ then, how many expressions can we make? I
          find 22, see that you agree. Do not worry about the column titles,
          they are explained later when I show you the procedure.
        </p>

          This means that $E(4)=2^3 \times 22 = 176$. Good thing I didn't write
          them all out...

        <h2>Free and Bound Expressions</h2>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          When constructing expressions, we need to know what we need should
          wrap parentheses around. For example $a+b\times c$ is different to
          $(a+b)\times c$, but the same as $a+(b\times c)$.
        </p>
        <p>
          An expression is called <u>free</u> if there is an addition or
          subtraction not within parentheses. Here are some free expressions:
        </p>
        $$a+b+c \qquad a+b\times c \qquad a\times b+c$$
        <p>
          If a string is not free, we say it is <u>bound</u>. Of the expressions
          discussed already, the following are bound.
        </p>
        $$a\times(b+c) \qquad (a+b)\times c \qquad a\times b\times c$$
        <p>
          The number of free and bound strings of length $L$ are denoted by
          $F(L)$ and $B(L)$ respectively. Looking at the previous lists of
          expressions, check that you agree $F(1)=0, F(2)=2, F(3)=12, F(4)=88$
          and $B(1)=0, B(2)=2, B(3)=12, B(4)=88$.
        </p>
        <p>
          At this point we might conjecture that $F(L)=B(L)$ for every $L>1$.
          This is proved later :)

        <p>
          We aim to implement the above strategy in Python to find the
          expressions of length $L$. To do this, we need to know them for length
          less than $L$. The only expression of length 1 is bound, and we will
          represent it using a blank symbol, such as a spcae or an underscore,
          to signify this is where the digit should be placed.

          'free_exprs' and 'bound_exprs' respectively to help find the
          expressions of length $L+1$ and so on. Because it is called only a
          handful of times, it does not need to be hyper-optimised, so I write
          them in these 'extend' blocks for readability.

          <a href="https://oeis.org/A156017">A156017</a>$(L-1)$. I later prove
          this to be the case, from which it follows that

        $$ E(L) \sim \frac{\sqrt{3\sqrt{2}-4}}{4\sqrt{\pi}}

          in the sense that $f(n)\sim g(n) \iff \lim\limits_{n\to\infty}
          \frac{f(n)}{g(n)} = 1$. From this it is immediate that

        $$ \lim\limits_{L\to\infty} \frac{E(L+1)}{E(L)} = 6+4\sqrt{2}$$
        <p>
          which is to say that each time we increase the length by one, the
          number of expressions grows by about a factor of $6+4\sqrt{2} \approx
          11.65685$. This grows even faster than the number of digit strings of

          >this blog post</a

        expressions are solutions. He finds that only 20% of these numbers are
        unsolvable. (I think there is a small difference to the rules of the
        game he is playing, but it is in essence the same problem.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I am only interested in whether the string is solvable, so we can go
        faster! We will first generate all of the expressions, then for each
        number, iterate through these expressions until we hit a zero, or run
        out. This should be a dramatic improvement, as we saw there is a
        god-awful number of possible expressions.

      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          Here is the rough blueprint of our method. There are a few things to
          note. The expressions can be made using the procedure of Chapter 0. We
          do not even consider digit strings that contain a zero, as they are
          trivially solvable. For each steo in the while loop, we increment the
          length by one and are counting the number of arrays of this that do
          not have a solution. As we proved earlier if this count is either 0 or
          1 we can stop.

        <h3>Problem 1 â€” Division by Zero</h3>
        <p>
          Imagine we are trying to check if $7123$ is solvable, and we try the
          expression $7\div(1+2-3)$. Our poor python script would not be happy,
          that's for sure.
        </p>
        <div class="thin_centre">
          <div class="python_terminal">
            <p>>>> print(7/(1+2-3))</p>
            <p>ZeroDivisionError: division by zero</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          This problem can easily be avoided, though. If the operation '$a\div
          b$' raises this error, it is because $b=0$. Clearly then $a\times
          b=0$. So, if we were to first try $7\times (1+2-3)$, this would give
          zero. We would stop trying expressions, and so would never try $7\div
          (1+2-3)$.
        </p>

        <p>
          So, imagine if we sort the expressions by the number of divisions.
          Then, we would never try $a\div b$ without first verifying $a\times b$
          was non-zero, which means $b$ is non-zero and $a\div b$ is not
          problematic. The cost to sorting the strings like this is not
          relatively large, as it needs to be done only once, when the list of
          expressions is generated.
        </p>

        <h3>Problem 2 â€” Floating Point Errors</h3>
        <p>
          The string 13946 is particularly annoying to work with, but serves as
          a good example. It can be solved by $1-3\div9-4\div6$. (In fact, this
          is the only solution. It not only needs a division to be solved, it
          actually needs 2!) You can see this is a solution, right? Well, Python
          can't...
        </p>
        <div class="thin_centre">
          <div class="python_terminal">
            <p>>>> print(1-3/9-4/6)</p>
            <p>1.1102230246251565e-16</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          We must try to avoid these floating point errors somehow. Consider
          working with pairs of integers $(a,b)$, for $b>0$ and
          $\text{gcd}(a,b)=1$. In this language, $(a,b)$ is understood as $a/b$.
          Then $(a,1)$ would be the integer $a$, and $(0,b)$ would be 0. These
          are the rationals $\mathbb{Q}$, which are closed under the four
          operations were are using. The operations can then be written purely
          in terms of integer arithmetic:
        </p>
        $$\begin{aligned} (a,b)+(c,d) &= (a\times d+b\times c, b\times d) \\
        (a,b)-(c,d) &= (a\times d-b\times c, b\times d) \\ (a,b)\times (c,d) &=
        (a\times c, b\times d) \\ (a,b)\div(c,d) &= (a\times d, b\times c)
        \end{aligned}$$
        <p>
          (At the end, remove common factors from the numerator and
          denominator.) Of course, I'm not actually bothered to code all of that
          up myself. There is a Python module called 'fractions' which does this
          for us. You can read about it
          <a href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html">here</a>.
          '$\text{Fraction}(a,b)$' is an object that behaves just like $(a,b)$
          above. We never need to worry about floating point errors again!
        </p>
        <p>
          Two small comments on this. Firstly, yes, the expressions now take
          longer to compute. An addition now requires 3 multiplications, an
          addition, and a gcd calculation. But we need the accuracy this
          provides. Luckily, we already agreed to sort the expressions by how
          many divisions they have. So, we can use integer arithmetic on the
          first group, those with no divisions. Then, use the fractions approach
          only for the rest. This should salvage back some time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, the floating point error problem could be avoided altogether
          by carefully redefining the game is such a way that at every step in
          the evaluation of the expression, all values must be integers. For
          example, you could consider 13946 to be unsolvable, because in the
          steops of calculating $1-3\div9-4\div6$ you have some non-integers
          $1/3$ and $2/3$. This is easy to do when actually playing in person.
          It is not so easy, and certainly would be slow, to ask the program to
          ensure we have an integer every time we divide. You are welcome to try
          that yourself :)

        <p>
          Using everything we have talked about, let's put this into action.
          First, when we generate the new expressions, we need to split them up
          into those with divisions, and those without. Also, we must order the
          ones with divisions by how many divisions they have. This can be done
          with the following function.

        <p>
          We will need to evaluate these expressions over each array of values.
          To prepare for this, we replace the blank character in a smart way.
          What I have chosen to do is replace the i'th appearance of the balnk
          character with 'x[i]', starting with i=0. Then, we can evaluate the
          string by just passing in an array of values called x. For example,
          using a as the blank character, the expression
          <span><code class="language-python">'a*(a+a)'</code></span> would then
          become
          <span><code class="language-python">'x[0]*(x[1]+x[2])'</code></span
          >. Using the array of values
          <span><code class="language-python">x=[1,2,3]</code></span
          >, the expression would give 1*(2+3)=5. Precompiling the expressions

          Next, we need to actually evaluate them when given a digit string, and
          stop if we hit a zero. We do integer arithmetic on the ones without
          divisions, and rational arithemtic on the rest. That way, if we find a
          zero without using a division, we save ourselves from needing to use
          rational arithmetic.

        Running the python program built above, we find that it terminates at
        length 7. There are exactly 3140 digit strings which have no solution,
        the longest of them being 8985898 â€” the only unsolvable of length 7.

        It does take a while to get there though. All but 90 of them were found
        in 20 seconds, but we did not finish for another 20 minutes! This is
        what we get for using brute force... Also, I am sure you can imagine the
        original versions of this code took <i>hours</i> to run.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that's it, we have solved the problem! Now we ask, has anyone done
        this before? If anyone else had, they would probably have put some
        evidence of it online. For example, the only unsolvable of length 7 is
        8985898. Looking this up on the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences
        (<a href="https://oeis.org/">OEIS</a>), we find that 8985898 appears in
        exactly one sequence,
        <a href="https://oeis.org/A288350">A288350</a>$(n)$, which is 1, 12,
        124, 1251, 12721, 169896, 8985898. Its title reads
        <i
          >"Lexically smallest string of $n$ digits from 1...9, such that no
          formula using the single digits in the given order exists that
          evaluates to 0."</i
        >
        This is exactly the problem we were solving, and it was solved at least
        as far back as 2017. This saves me the hassle of having to write you
        with a list of all of the unsolvable strings, as they already exist.
      </p>
      <p>So, how many unsolvables are there:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>with 1 digit? Clearly 9, which are 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with 2 digits? Clearly 72, which are '$ab$' for
            $a,b\in\{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9\}$ with $a\neq b$.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with 3 digits? See <a href="https://oeis.org/A288353">A288353</a>,
            there are 455.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with 4 digits? See <a href="https://oeis.org/A288354">A288354</a>,
            there are 1500.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with 5 digits? See <a href="https://oeis.org/A288355">A288355</a>,
            there are 1014.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            with 6 digits? See <a href="https://oeis.org/A288356">A288356</a>,
            there are 89.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>with 7 digits? Only 1, which is 8985898.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>with >7 digits? None!</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>in total? 3140.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The number for each length $L$>0 is given by
        <a href="https://oeis.org/A288351">A288351</a>$(L)$, which is 9, 72,
        455, 1500, 1014, 89, 1, and 0 thereafter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Funny story: before I realised I had to be careful with division,
        floating point errors caused my code to think 13946 was unsolvable.
        (Recall the only solution to this string is 1-3/9-4/6.) This made the
        'total' 3141, and I remember being just a little panicked that $\pi$
        seemed to show up...
      </p>
      <p>
        So there we go. There are 3140 that cannot be solved. So that's the end
        right? No.

        For one thing, I'm a masochist with an addiction to optimisation. The
        more important reason, is why are we using the digits $0,\cdots, 9$? The
        game can of course be played for digits $0, \cdots, b-1$ for any other
        integer $b>1$. What does the answer look like then? You might notice,
        that I always had a variable called 'base'...

      <h1>Chapter 2: Brute Force but Smarter</h1>
      <p>
        The basic idea is to add a series of increasingly expensive filters to
        weed out digit strings that are solvable. This way not all of them need
        to go through the more expensive tests, such as checking all of the
        possible expressions.
      </p>

      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>
          A square is a digit string of the form $'XX'$ for some string $'X'$.
          For example, $11$, $2323$, $97349734$ are all squares. A square is
          almost trivially solvable. Use any expression you like on both copies
          of $'X'$, and place a minus sign between them. Our previous examples
          are solved by, for example, $1-1$, $2\times3-2\times3$ and
          $9\times(7+3\times4)-9\times(7+3\times4)$ respectively.
        </p>
        <p>
          As you can imagine, checking if a string is a square is really cheap.

            According to the above logic then, we can check if a digit string
            contains a square in $\mathcal{O}(L^3)$ steps. This is massively
            cheap.
          </p>

          <p>
            But note that this is suboptimal. When checking if $12145$ contains
            a square, this algorithm checks if each of 12, 21, 14, 45, 1214,
            2145 are squares. For 1214, it checks if 1=1, which it is, and so
            then it checks if 2=4. But notice that 2=4? will be checked again
            for 2145. This may not seem like a big deal now, but as $L$ grows,
            the number of these repeated checks grows too. A better algorithm
            would avoid these...

            There is a small oprimisation to be made. Near the end, there might

          Implementing this, only square-free strings are allowed through.
          Enumerating square-free strings of length $L$ over an alphabet of
          $c>2$ characters is a classical and well-studied problem. See
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square-free_word"
            >this Wikipedia article</a
          >, <a href="https://oeis.org/A006156">this OEIS page</a>
          and links therein. It is known that as $L$ increases, the number grows
          as $\Theta(\alpha_c^L)$, for some constant $c-2<\alpha_c< c-1$. The
          one relevant to us right now is $\alpha_9 \approx 7.8729902$, as we
          are using the digits $1,\cdots, 9$. This means that the more expensive
          tests will only be done for $\Theta(\alpha_9^L)$ digit strings instead
          of $9^L$. This is a very significant decrease in the search space, and
          for a low cost!
        </p>
        <p>
          When using the (non-zero) digits of base $b$ (that is $1, \cdots,
          b-1$) there are $(b-1)^L$ digit strings of length $L$. Our original
          brute force algorithm used an expensive procedure to test each of
          these. Now, we first filter out the strings containing squares.
