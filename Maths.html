        Here is where I will shove some maths that I find interesting. The
        problems I have actually worked on will be put in the
        <a href="Projects.html">Projects</a> section.

        <h3>Contour Integration as a Root-Finding Method</h3>
      </button>
      <div class="accordion_panel">
        <p>This is a really bad method.</p>
        <p>
          Root-finding is the problem of finding where a function is zero. In
          the diagram below, it means finding where the curve crosses the
          \(x\)-axis. This location is called the root, and is denoted \(x_0\).
          Sometimes, we cannot solve this exactly, and must turn to numerically
          approximating it. There are many good methods to do this. Using \(N\)
          evaluations, the bisection method can achieve an error that is
          \(\mathcal{O}(2^{-N})\), and assuming the function is 'nice', there
          are much faster methods available.
        </p>
        <img class="centre" src="images/root_finding.jpg" style="width: 50%" />
        <p>
          To use this new method, we must place several strong assumptions on
          the function \(f\). First, there exists a complex extension of \(f\)
          on some known open subset \(U\subset\mathbb{C}\) that contains the
          root \(z_0\) we want. Second, we can construct some loop \(\gamma\)
          within \(U\) that encloses \(z_0\). We also need the winding number of
          \(\gamma\) about \(z_0\) to be 1, and for \(z_0\) to be zero of order
          one of \(f\).
        </p>
        <p>
          Here is a schematic diagram of the complex plane around the root
          \(z_0\). The dashed line represents the boundary of \(U\). Within this
          region, \(f\) is assumed to be holomorphic (very very smooth and
          nice). The loop \(\gamma\) is within \(U\), and goes around \(z_0\)
          once, counter-clockwise.
        </p>
        <img
          class="centre"
          src="images/root_finding_2.jpg"
          style="width: 50%"
        />
        <p>
          Then, if we integrate \(z/f(z)\) and \(1/f(z)\) along the curve
          \(\gamma\), the resulting ratio will be the root we are looking for!
        </p>
        $$\left.\oint_\gamma\frac{z}{f(z)}dz \right/
        \oint_\gamma\frac{1}{f(z)}dz = z_0 $$
        <p>
          This is called a coutour integral, where \(\gamma\) is the contour.
          Evaluating these can be fun, but most analytic methods revolve around
          knowing the singularities of the integrand. That is, where the
          function to be integrated diverges. In this case, there is exactly
          one, and it is \(z_0\)... but we don't know where it is!
          <i>That is the whole point!</i> So we must turn to numerical
          approximation.
        </p>
        <p>
          This still doesn't sound too awful. Just numerically approximate the
          integral, and this will still approximate the root. Using a smooth
          contour \(\gamma\), and numerically integrating using the trapezoid
          method with \(N\) evaluations, we can show that the resulting error
          will drop faster than all powers of \(N\). What we cannot do, however,
          is guarantee that the error will drop faster than that of the
          bisection method. Which is embarrassing, as that is perhaps the most
          simple root-finding algorithm, and this is far, far more expensive!
        </p>
        <p>
          So from both analytical and numerical points of view, this method is
          useless. But because it pops out of some really nice maths, it gets
          rediscovered from time to time. It got a bit of media fanfare when it
          was used offhand in
          <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00283-020-09966-0"
            >this paper</a
          >
          from 2020. The author derived a transcendental equation, the root of
          which was a number that solved
          <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goat_grazing_problem#Interior_grazing_problem"
            >the Grazing Goat problem</a
          >
          . At the end, the author constructs such an integral from the
          equation, and claims this is a <i>"closed-form solution"</i> for the
          root.
        </p>
        <p>
          In the few years since, some physicists ahve applied this approach to
          derive 'explicit solutions' to famous transcendental equations in
          theoretical physics, such as
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kepler%27s_equation">
            Kepler's equation</a
          >
          and Homologous Collapse. For example,
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.15829">Kepler's Goat Herd</a> and
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.09823"
            >A Uniform Spherical Goat (Problem)</a
          >. As you can tell from the names of the papers, these are probably
          mostly tongue-in-cheek. But I have strong opinions on this — it is
          disingenuous to call these 'explicit' or 'closed-form' solutions.
          Unless you can solve the integrals analytically, this is only a
          numerical root-finding method, and a pretty bad one at that.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anyway, despite the fact the method is terrible, I did spend some time
          thinking about how to improve it. The rough goal is to
          <i>steel-man</i> the method — to make a stronger version of it, and
          then to demonstrate this stronger version is still bad. (If you want
          some spoilers, ask me.)
