      <h1>Speedcubing</h1>
      <p>
        I am sure you have heard of a Rubik's cube.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a>
        is the solving of this puzzle (or one of its variants) as fast as
        possible.
      </p>
      <h2>How to Learn</h2>
      <p>
        If you are curious to learn, there are hundreds of tutorials on YouTube.
        Search for a 'beginner's method', and if you want to improve, look for
        some basic
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_method">CFOP</a>. I would
        recommend the channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm">JPerm</a>. Between that and his
        <a href="https://jperm.net/">website</a>, you will find everything you
        would ever need. Also, the entire community is extremely friendly and
        open to new members. There is most likely a group of speedcubers in your
        country you can contact, for example see
        <a href="https://www.speedcubingireland.com/">Speedcubing Ireland</a>
        and the linked discord channel. Happy solving!
      </p>

      <h2><i>'Isn't it all just algorithms?'</i></h2>
      <p>
        No. Solving these puzzles can be split into two phases. First, just
        moving pieces around to where they belong. This is just on-the-spot
        problem-solving, done by the intuition built though experience.
        Eventually though, so many pieces are in place that you cannot do
        anything without disturbing your progress. Only then do we turn to
        algorithms, sequences of moves which are memorised and practiced to be
        recognised and performed extremely quickly. While speedcubers might know
        hundreds of algorithms, it is possible to solve the cube in under 30
        seconds consistently knowing only 4 algorithms!
      </p>

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Some time around October of 2018, I pulled a Rubik's cube out of a
        drawer and thought to myself 'Surely I can learn how to solve this'. So
        I found a tutorial on YouTube, and 5 minutes later, the cube was
        solved!* Within a few days, I had learned off the steps of the
        begginer's method, and could solve the cube in under 5 minutes. This is
        the first addiction, just solving the cube. The second addiction kicks
        in later, when you start timing yourself, and watching your times go
        down with practice. That January, I bought myself my first 'speedcube',
        a Moyu GTS3M, which was kind of new at the time. Within a few days of
        that, my record was falling towards 20 seconds.
      </p>

      <p>
        My parents also bought me a 5x5 that Christmas, and I realised this was
        even more fun. Remember that the last portion of the solve is just
        algorithms? I don't like this section, I much prefer <i>finding</i> a
        solution over memorising one. On a 3x3, the algorithmic section takes
        about half of the solve for me. But, on larger cubes, the intuitive
        section is far longer. So, I prefer the larger cubes, 4x4 - 7x7.
      </p>
      <p>
        I attended my first competition that summer, and it was so much fun! A
        room full of people with the same hobby, with the mutual goal of beating
        their own records. (Only the best were actually aiming to try get a
        podium.) Upcoming competitions are listed
        <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions?">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I started to really enjoy the 4x4 and 5x5 cubes. Actually, I
        was starting to creep towards being sub-40 on a 4x4, (I think the second
        best in the country was a 37 average at the time). And then BOOM,
        pandemic, cancelling all competitions. I would not get my first podium
        until we returned after the pandemic. In 2022 and 2023, I was mediocre
        at the larger cubes (4x4-7x7) at a time when few others in Ireland were.
        I started winning some competitions on these cubes. I earned 2 podiums
        at each of the 2022 and 2023 Irish Championships, and I was ranked top 3
        in the country at 4x4, 5x5 and 7x7.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was not a concious decision, but for a few factors I have stopped
        competing. University work was piling up so I practiced less which
        caused my times to plateau, the next generation is so fast that I felt
        washed up, accomodation for competitions is expensive for a student, and
        I broke my wrist in 2024 and it never fully healed. Oh well. It is still
        a hobby in my free time, but I am not as aggressively trying to improve.
        Maybe I'll go to a competition in 2026, but not with any hope of doing
        well.

        is pretty boring now, I will soon be out of the national top 10 in every
        category.
