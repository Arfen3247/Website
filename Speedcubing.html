      <h1>Speedcubing</h1>

      <h2>How to Learn</h2>
      <p>
        I am sure you have heard of a Rubik's cube.
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speedcubing">Speedcubing</a>
        is the solving of this puzzle (or one of its variants) as fast as
        possible. If you are curious to learn, there are hundreds of tutorials
        on YouTube. Search for a 'beginner's method', and if you want to
        improve, look for some basic
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CFOP_method">CFOP</a>. I would
        recommend the channel
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JPerm">JPerm</a>. Between that and his
        <a href="https://jperm.net/">website</a>, you will find everything you
        would ever need. Also, the entire community is extremely friendly and
        open to new members. There is most likely a group of speedcubers in your
        country you can contact, for example see
        <a href="https://www.speedcubingireland.com/">Speedcubing Ireland</a>
        and the linked discord channel. Upcoming competitions are listed
        <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/competitions?">here</a>.
        Happy solving!
      </p>

      <h2><i>'Isn't it all just algorithms?'</i></h2>
      <p>
        No. Solving these puzzles can be split into two phases. First, just
        moving pieces around to where they belong. This is just on-the-spot
        problem-solving, done by the intuition built though experience.
        Eventually though, so many pieces are in place that you cannot do
        anything without disturbing your progress. Only then do we turn to
        algorithms, sequences of moves which are memorised and practiced to be
        recognised and performed extremely quickly. For me on a standard 3x3
        cube, these stages take about equal time (YMMV), but on larger cubes
        (4x4, 5x5 etc), the intuitive stage lasts longer. Personally, this is
        the part that I really enjoy and so I always preferred the larger cubes.
        I love <i>finding</i> a solution, not memorising one, so I know only
        about 100 algorithms, where others would know far far more. However, it
        is possible to solve the cube in under 30 seconds consistently knowing
        only 4 algorithms!

      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        Some time around October of 2018, I pulled a Rubik's cube out of a
        drawer and thought to myself 'Surely I can learn how to solve this'. So
        I found a tutorial on YouTube, and 5 minutes later, the cube was
        solved!* Within a few days, I had learned off the steps of the
        begginer's method, and could solve the cube in under 5 minutes. This is
        the first addiction, just solving the cube. The second addiction kicks
        in later, when you start timing yourself, and watching your times go
        down with practice. That January, I bought myself my first 'speedcube',
        a Moyu GTS3M, which was kind of new at the time. Within a few days of
        that, my record was falling towards 20 seconds. My parents also bought
        me a 5x5 that Christmas, and I realised this was even more fun. yada
        yada yada. I attended my first competition that summer, and it was so
        much fun! A room full of people with the same hobby, with the mutual
        goal of beating their own records. (Only the best were actually aiming
        to try get a podium.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, I started to really enjoy the 4x4 and 5x5 cubes. Actually, I
        was starting to creep towards being sub-40 on a 4x4, (I think the second
        best in the country was 37 at the time). And then BOOM, pandemic. The
        competition was cancelled. I would not get my first podium until we
        returned after the pandemic, in 2022.
      </p>
      <p>
        I never meade the concious decision to stop cubing, but for a few
        factors I have stopped competing. University work was piling up so I
        practiced less which caused my times to plateau, the next generation is
        so fast that I felt washed up, accomodation for competitions is
        expensive for a student, and I broke my wrist in 2024 and it never fully
        healed. Oh well. It is still a hobby in my free time, but I am not as
        aggressively trying to improve. Maybe I'll go to a competition in 2026.
        My profile can be seen
        <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2019FURL04"
          >here</a
        >. It is pretty boring now, I will soon be out of the national top 10 in
        every category.
